# JSON to YML
## Intro
Transforms Json into Yaml.

## Usage
Only works with stdin and stdout, no plans of supporting further cases.

## Install
Build it:
```go
$ go build -o json2yaml ./main.go
```

Copy the file to any directory in your path.

## Conslusions
This was suposed to be a joke, but found it quite usefull, the real joke is my
life at this point.


And that's it, minimalist, as every Go program should be.
